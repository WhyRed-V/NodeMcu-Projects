# NODEMCU

NodeMCU is a low-cost open source IoT platform. It initially included firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which was based on the ESP-12 module.

# WIFI JAMMER USING NODEMCU

This is a small project which shows how to jam a wifi network or performing a beacon / probe attack to that network.





## Installation Process

1. Download esp8266 deauther 2.6.1 DSTIKE USB DEAUTHER bin file from the github or go to this link http://deauther.com/docs/download binaries->dstike->Usb deauther
2. Connect the NodeMcu with your pc for the driver Installation Process after then once restart your PC.
3. Open this website https://esp.huhn.me/ on Chrome or Edge and then reconnect your NodeMcu and select on Connect.
