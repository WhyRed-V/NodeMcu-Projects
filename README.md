# NODEMCU

NodeMCU is a low-cost open source IoT platform. It initially included firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which was based on the ESP-12 module.

# WIFI JAMMER USING NODEMCU

This is a small project which shows how to jam a wifi network or performing a beacon / probe attack to that network.
